# 1.- Introduction
At home, my main device is and old Surface Pro 3 with 125gb. I have an old lantop, a gaming PC, my wife its lantop, some external hhd...information is very scattered. With the aim of centralize and make more accesible all our info, I would like to implement a NAS on my network.

This project would try to evaluate different possibilities and go ahead with the final choose.

# 2.- Define

## 2.1- Goal
- I think that I won't need a big capacity, but you know, the future.... I prefer to have more units of lower capacity. Based on this constrain, the system must be capable to manage 2 hard disk units.
- Minimum electrical conection will be an advance
- Cheaper teh better

## 2.2- Cases
Study cases will be defined in the next lines:

- CASE 1: Comercial NAS. Easier and faster option. No knowledge or welder skill are required. DS220j
- CASE 2: wDiy. Called "w" due to welder skill are needed. 3D printer are needed. Source: https://electrotutoriales.com/servidor-nas-con-raspberry-pi-hardware/
- CASE 3: fDiy. Called "f" due to the creator is French. No welder skill are required, 3D printer are needed. Source: https://youtu.be/suCkt-MaWJs
- CASE 4: Docker station. Just use a doker to feed hdd.
- CASE 5: ownDIY. Case 3 modified toavoid using PSU
